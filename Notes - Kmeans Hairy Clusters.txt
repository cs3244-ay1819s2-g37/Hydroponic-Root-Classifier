Notes for KMeans - Hairy Roots Clustering

Kmeans = 2:
Group 0: thinner roots and fewer roots
Group 1: appears to have hairier and thicker roots

Kmeans = 3
Group 0: average number of roots, mostly to one side of the image
Group 1: not so dark, not many roots, thinner roots
Group 2: darker, roots grown well on both sides of the image


Appears that the images:
100_a, 101_a, 102_a, 103_a, 104_a, 105_a

are always in the same group. perhaps there's more similarity in them.
